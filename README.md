**Time Estimate:** 20 minutes

**Description:** Write a Java program that reads data from one file using `FileChannel` and `ByteBuffer`, and then writes the data to another file. This exercise simulates a file copying operation.

**Guidelines:**

1. Create a `FileChannel` for reading from an input file (e.g., "input.txt") and another for writing to an output file (e.g., "output.txt").

2. Use a `ByteBuffer` to read data from the input channel and write it to the output channel.

3. Ensure proper exception handling and resource cleanup.
